Network-wide ads & trackers blocking DNS server.

![The AdGuard Home Home Assistant Add-on](images/screenshot.png)

## About

AdGuard Home is a network-wide ad-and-tracker blocking DNS server with
parental control (adult content blocking) capabilities. Its purpose is to let
you control your entire network and all your devices, and it does not require
using a client-side program.

AdGuard Home provides a beautiful, easy and feature-rich web interface to
easily manage the filtering process and its settings.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. **Ensure your Home Assistant device has a
   [static IP and static external DNS servers!](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassos/blob/dev/Documentation/network.md#static-ip)**
   This is important! You **WILL** end up having issues if you skip this step.
   Also, please note, setting a fixed IP in your router is **NOT** static.
1. Search for the "AdGuard Home" add-on in the Supervisor add-on store and
   install it.
1. Start the "AdGuard Home" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "AdGuard Home" to see if everything went well.
1. Click the "OPEN WEB UI" button and log in with your Home Assistant account.
1. Ready to go!

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
ssl: true
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the add-on. Set it `true` to enable it,
`false` otherwise.

**Note**: _The SSL settings only apply to direct access and has no effect
on the Ingress service._

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option: `leave_front_door_open`

Adding this option to the add-on configuration allows you to disable
authentication on the AdGuard Home by setting it to `true`.

**Note**: _We STRONGLY suggest, not to use this, even if this add-on is
only exposed to your internal network. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!_
